- Marsiya - elegiac poems commemorating the martyrdom of Hussain
- Kasida - the tradition of singing praise to warriors
- Wali Dakhani's diwan took the group of poets, all of those who wrote in Persian by storm. He became a cultural bridge between the north and the south, and the founding father of Urdu poetry. In this way he has played a massive role.
