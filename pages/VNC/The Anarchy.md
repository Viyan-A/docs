- THE BATTLE OF PLASSEY
- Robert Clive’s journey to Murshidabad in 1757 was the most important act in establishing British rule over India.
- After his victory in the Battle of Plassey, where he led the East India Company forces, though outnumbered,  to defeat Siraj-ud-Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal, Clive decided to head on to Murshidabad which was then the capital of Bengal and an important centre of trade and politics.
- Clive wanted to establish and ensure British dominance over Murshidabad in both, an economic and political way.
- On his way to Murshidabad, he orchestrated a plan with Mir Jafar, he also contemplated on whether he should continue to Murshidabad with a guise of wanting to discuss and resolve matters regarding the treaty even with a low amount of troops.
- Due to pressure from Robert Clive, Mir Jafar was forced to sign various treaties that granted the British East India Company major privileges, such as not having to pax tax for the import of goods as well as trading rights.
- They were also granted quite a bit of financial help from Bengal.
- The agreements allowed the British to take over Bengal’s immense wealth, transforming Murshidabad into an asset for British economic expansion. Clive himself gained personally, amassing a large fortune from the new arrangement.
- The wealth funneled from Bengal fueled the British economy, while Murshidabad’s control gave the British dominance over Bengal’s extensive trade networks. Clive’s actions and policies in Murshidabad marked a shift from merely economic interest to overt political control, establishing the East India Company as a de facto governing power. This influence would lay the foundation for a larger colonial structure over the next two centuries.
- Thus, Clive’s activities in Murshidabad were not only decisive in British colonial history but also led to profound impacts on Bengal’s economy and governance, ultimately shaping the trajectory of British rule in India.
- Mir Jafar wasn't exactly the quickest person in sending letters, this made Robert Clive hesitant to advance, and after having reread Mir Jafar's letter Clive was increasingly suspicious that he was being led into a trap, due to this he sent a letter to Mir Jafar stating how it is deeply concerning that he is not expressing himself and his situation more.
- Clive also states in his letter to Mir Jafar that he has not been given the least information or about what measures are required for him to take, nor does he know about what is happening currently in Murshidabad.
- But eventually, after calling a Council of War to decide whether he should advance with the campaign, he decided to march forward. After a while, Clive reached Murshidabad. On the morning of June the 22nd, Clive decided to climb onto the flat roof of the hunting lodge to get a better idea of what he was up against.
- There were multiple elephants, all covered in scarlet embroidery, horses, and their heavy cannon pulled by a large amount of oxen, they made a fabulous sight.
- All in all, Clive estimated that the Nawab's forces consisted of around 35,000 infantry, 15,000 cavalry and 53 pieces of heavy artillery gunned by a team of French experts. With their back to Hugli, by 8:00 in the morning, there was no escape for Clive's troops, regardless of whether Mir Jafar kept his word to help Clive or not, there was no other option for Clive but to fight.
- At eight, a cannonade began and Clive quickly lost 30 sepoys, after this, he brought back his men under the muddy riverbank surrounding the mango grave. Now there was a real danger of encirclement. Many of the officers were as doubtful of the chance of victory, including Robert Clive. The army led by Siraj-ud-Daulah kept on pushing, this is where the positioning of Robert Clive's army came in handy. To succeed in seizing their cannon was almost near impossible as their army was around the army of Clive, and at a considerable distance from each other at that. The British hence remained quite in their post, hoping that an attack in the night would be successful.
- When noon was approaching, the skies began to darken and a storm broke over the battlefield soaking the army and turning the ground into a muddy swamp instantly. Luckily for them, the Company troops kept their powder and fuses dry under tarpaulins, but the Mughals did not. Within 10 minutes, Clive climbed the roof of the hunting lodge after having worn a dry uniform and observed that all of the guns of Siraj-ud-daulah's army had fallen silent.
- Assuming the Company's guns would also be inactive, Mir Madan, the Nawab's cavalry commander gave the order to advance, 5,000 of his elite Afghan horses charged to the Company's right, though unfortunately for them, many were killed including Mir Madan himself.
- After seeing this, the mindset of Siraj-ud-daulah's army changed and the soldiers went into the tents taking with the the corpse of Mir Madan. At midday, multiple soldiers began fleeing from the tents and began to take to their heels, this was when Major Kilpatrick decided to advance to hold the abandoned positions. He did this without permission and Clive was rightfully mad and threatened to arrest Major Kilpatrick for disobeying his orders. This decision however, by Major Kilpatrick, won them the battle.
- AFTER THE BATTLE OF PLASSEY
- Siraj-ud-Daula escaped back to Murshidabad on a camel and collected whatever jewels of his that he could, he then, along with 2 or 3 attendants ran away. In the aftermath of the battle, it is calculated that about 500 of the Nawab's army was killed while only 22 were killed on the British side while 50 were injured.
- On June 24, clive wrote a letter to Mir Jafar which congratulated him on the victory that was supposedly not his but rather that of Mir Jafar's , he also stated that he now had the honor of assigning the role of Nawab to Mir Jafar. Later that same morning, a very nervous and exhausted Mir Jafar showed up at Clive's camp. Though he was startled at first by the guards, he became calm when Clive welcomed him into his tent.
- Clive wasn't planning any mischief as the desire he had to win the battle was more than that of him wanting to use Jafar as a puppet to control Bengal, he then told Jafar to go to Murshidabad and take control over it, he sent Watts along with him who was in charge of keeping an eye on the treasure, Clive followed them slowly. It took 3 entire days for him and his army to reach Murshidabad as it was 50 miles that they had to cover.
- Clive was supposed to enter Murshidabad on June 27th but he was warned by the Jagat Seths that an assassination attempt was being put in place, so it was only on June 29th that Robert Clive was brought into Murshidabad by the new Nawab Mir Jafar. There was a lot of music, drums and colors and he was escorted by a guard of more than 500 soldiers. Robert Clive then said that he and the Company would not interfere in the state and stay only as business partners in the form of commerce and such. Mir Jafar then took possession of Bengal and was quietly acknowledged as the new Nawab.
- Due to all of this, Clive became immensely wealthy, he would become one of the richest men in Europe, but only if the money was paid. After this the next few days was very tense for Clive. He was scared he would be betrayed by the old general (Mir Jafar) and that he wouldn't receive his money at all. Jafar and Clive both watched each other closely while the Seths looked for the money.
- Later Siraj-ud-Daula was killed and his remains were paraded through the streets, on July 7th, Robert Clive finally got his money, it was one of the largest corporate gains in history, in the modern rate he made around $22 Million. He immediately moved his winnings to Kolkata and became one of the richest men in Europe.
- The young Warren Hastings at Murshidabad had been the first to raise the issue, he realized the growing instability at the Murshidabad court. Before Clive left, Jafar was only able to pay around 3 months of his army's 13 months of arrears of pay. As a result whichever troops weren't paid were openly frustrated and were starving and struggling as well.
- The Mughal capital of Dehli was faring even worse than Murshidabad as the city was constantly being raided from the north and the south by the Marathas and the Afghan invaders. Even in all of this, Imad ul-Mulk had somehow kept his power throughout the ruins of Delhi with the help of the Marathas.
- Shah Alam's father, Alamgir II was killed by Imad ul-Mulk, the news of the assassination reached Shah Alam a couple of weeks after. The prince was still wandering in the east. The Shah Alam Nama, the offical court chronicle of his shows us how the young prince was touring and going around the Ganges plains giving titles and promising estates and trying to gather support from the locals, similar as to how in today's world an Indian politician would behave to gather votes before the elections.
